# 2022 IAQF Student Competition 2022
This repository contains the solution for 2022 IAQF(International Association for Quantitative Finance) Student Competition.

The question is concerning develop a technique to predict or determine the “hidden” state of the market: bear, bull, or static. Prove the validity of your approach by comparing a trading strategy(no leverage) based on the technique against a buy-and-hold strategy for the years 2018 to 2021.

## `Codes` Folder
This project focuses on classifying market states into bull, bear and static. We utilize traditional Set of Rules and Hidden Markov Models to create labels, and then build classical and neural networks to train our models. Finally, we build a simple trading strategy to compare our results with buy-and-hold strategy.


## Final Solution
Here we also upload a final solusion(paper) named IAQF_2022_Solution.pdf.
